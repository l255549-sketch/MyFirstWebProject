        Nostalgia is a <b> bittersweet emotion that transports us back to cherished moments of the past, often triggered by a familiar scent, song, or place. </b> It carries with it a warmth that reminds us of simpler times, childhood joys, or meaningful connections, yet it also <i> stirs a gentle longing for what can never </i> fully return. In many ways, nostalgia acts as a bridge between who we once were and who we have become, offering comfort in memory while highlighting the passage of time. <u>It is both a celebration of life’s fleeting </u> beauty and a quiet reminder of its impermanence.

    <p style="font-size:12px;">Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans, capable of tasks such as reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making.</p>
    <p style="font-size:18px;">This field encompasses various technologies like machine learning and natural language processing and has applications in everything from medical diagnosis and search engines to self-driving cars and virtual assistants</p>
    <p style="font-size:24px;"> AI systems perceive their environment, process data, and can adapt their behavior based on analysis of past actions to achieve specific goals. AI systems are designed to perform tasks that have historically required human intelligence, including reasoning, learning, planning, and creativity.</p>
